// Subsets of JavaScript, starting from the grammar as defined at
// http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/9.0/#sec-grammar-summary

// Justin is the safe JavaScript expression language, a potentially
// pure decidable superset of JSON and subset of Jessie, that relieves
// many of the pain points of using JSON as a data format:
//   * unquoted indentifier property names.
//   * comments.
//   * multi-line strings (via template literals).
//   * undefined.
//   * includes all floating point values: NaN, Infinity, -Infinity
//   * will include BigInt once available.

// Justin also includes most pure JavaScript expressions. Justin does not
// include function expressions or variable or function
// definitions. However, it does include free variable uses and
// function calls; so the purity and decidability of Justin depends on
// the endowments provided for these free variable bindings.

// Justin is defined to be extended into the Jessie grammar, which is
// defined to be extended into the JavaScript grammar.
// See https://github.com/Agoric/Jessie/blob/master/README.md
// for documentation of the Jessie grammar.

// Justin is defined to be extended into the Chainmail grammar, to
// provide its expression language in a JS-like style. Chainmail
// expressions need to be pure and should be decidable.
